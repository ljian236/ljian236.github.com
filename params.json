I am also working on the online trace reduction (see IEEE TPDS 2013, ISSRE 2011) related to data race detection.\r\n\r\nThese two papers present an overview on part of my work: ECOOP 2012 DS (presented at ECOOP 2012 Doctoral Symposium) and TSETH 2013 (including some ideas on implementation of my research tools and some demo screenshots) .\r\n\r\n##Academic Services\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n##Publications\r\n###Journal Papers\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n###Conference Papers\r\n\r\n",
